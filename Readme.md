## C++ - Module 00 
This module introduces core concepts in C++ such as namespaces, classes, member functions, initialization lists, static and const members, and other basic topics, through hands-on exercises to help build a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming.

### Exercise 00: Megaphone

I created a program that converts input text to uppercase and outputs it. If no arguments are given, the program outputs a loud noise. This exercise helped me practice handling command-line arguments and working with strings in C++.

### Exercise 01: My Awesome PhoneBook

Objective: I implemented a simple phonebook program using two classes: PhoneBook and Contact. The phonebook can store a maximum of 8 contacts and handles three commands: ADD, SEARCH, and EXIT. This exercise allowed me to practice implementing user interaction through the console.

### Exercise 02: The Job Of Your Dreams

Objective: I recreated the Account class after its implementation was lost. By using the provided header file and log files, I wrote the missing source code to match the log output. This exercise focused on class implementation and understanding how the components of a program can interact to fulfill a task.
